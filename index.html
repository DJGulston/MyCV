                        <p>
                            I am a BSc graduate from the University of Johannesburg. Since my high school days, I've had a strong 
                            interest in learning more about computers and technology in general. I consider myself to be a "left-brain" 
                            thinker, as my strengths have always been in mathematics and logic. So, naturally, I considered pursuing 
                            tertiary studies in statistics and computer science, as it was something I was both interested in and 
                            naturally good at.
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            Upon completing my first semester at university, I realised that my interests gravitated strongly towards 
                            computer science and I figured that I will pursue a career in programming/coding one day. However, I chose to 
                            keep statistics as a major, as I wanted to keep my options open in case my opinion changed. My plan B was to 
                            pursue a career in statistics potentially as a data analyst or data scientist. But I can safely say that my 
                            opinion has not changed ever since.
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            What makes coding/programming so interesting to me is that it I can see my logic come to life. Trying new 
                            things and seeing the results in front of me is what motivates me to go even further. To me, planning and 
                            doing a task go hand-in-hand. Without fundamental planning, you cannot do the task, and without doing the 
                            task, you cannot plan any further.
